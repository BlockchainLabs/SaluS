Kick Starter Coins: Below is a list of coins that will be included during the initial phase of this project.  Listed coins will stake on behalf of SaluS project, stakes will be sold on exchanges to increase BTC reserve.   Cloud Staking Service: Fees will be 5% of the stakes, however, the advantages listed below easily outweigh the fees.  1) Experience, keen knowledge of Coin specs. 2) Customized wallets for optimum stacking 3) Staking Advantage, (whaling weight/diff), Research for Optimum block size. 4) 24/7 Uptime, No Hassle, no worry, No Resource staking.  Affiliate programs: All profit made from affiliate programs will go to SaluS reserve to increase NAV.  If you hold Salus coin and would like to help your investment grow, sign up for the services listed below using provided links.  Foundation Transaction Fee - .0001 This is a separate TX fee of .0001 that goes to a specific Address, called the Foundation Transaction fee. This fee is in place for couple of reasons. 1) To control inflation since the supply is set to increase by 1% annually. 2) Resold to increase the reserve.  Mining Guaranteed Minimum CPU hash rate of 1000H/s   Would encourage everyone invested in this coin with CPU power to spare, to click on the link below. link will be up soon.  Traders Advantage: Top 10 Claimed Addresses on the rich list will have access to all trades and portfolio activity/status in near real time. There will be a fee for those who are not on top 10 list but would like to have access to such information. All fees will be added to the reserve fund.  MultiPool: http://hashgoal.com/  "Holy Grail" - Financial Instrument Will not disclose any information about this project at this time, but I do believe this will take SaluS to a whole new level if it gets off the ground.   (details on this project will be announced as soon as development officially starts)
